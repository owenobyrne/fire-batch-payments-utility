  description: >
    The fire.com API allows you to deeply integrate Business Account features
    into your application or back-office systems.


    The API provides read access to your profile, accounts and transactions,
    event-driven notifications of activity on the account and payment initiation
    via batches. Each feature has its own HTTP endpoint and every endpoint has
    its own permission.



    The API exposes 3 main areas of functionality: financial functions, service
    information and service configuration.

    ## Financial Functions

    These functions provide access to your account details, transactions, payee
    accounts, payment initiation etc.

    ## Service Functions

    These provide information about the fees and limits applied to your account.

    ## Service configuration

    These provide information about your service configs - applications,
    webhooks, API tokens, etc.

      summary: Authenticate with the API.
      description: >
        Access to the API is by Bearer Tokens. The process is somewhat similar
        to OAuth2.0, but with some changes to improve security.

          1. You must first log into the firework online application and create a new Application in the Profile > API page. (You will need your PIN digits and 2-Factor Authentication device).
          
          2. Give your application a Name and select the scope/permissions you need the application to have (more on Scopes below).
          
          3. You will be provided with three pieces of information - the App Refresh Token, Client ID and Client Key. You need to take note of the Client Key when it is displayed - it will not be shown again.
          
          
          You now use these pieces of data to retrieve a short-term Access Token which you can use to access the API. The Access Token expires within a relatively short time, so even if it is compromised, the attacker will not have long to use it. The Client Key is the most important piece of information to keep secret. This should only ever be stored on a backend server, and never in a front end client or mobile app.


          **If you ever accidentally reveal the Client Key (or accidentally commit it to Github for instance) it is vital that you log into firework online and delete/recreate the App Tokens as soon as possible. Anyone who has these three pieces of data can access the API to view your data and set up payments from your account (depending on the scope of the tokens).**
          
          
          Once you have the access token, pass it as a header for every call, like so:

          `Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN`

          Whenever it expires, create a new nonce and get a new access token again.

      summary: Create a Fire Open Payment request
      description: >
        Fire Open Payments is a feature of the fire.com business account that
        leverages Open Banking to allow your customers to pay you via bank
        transfer and to reconcile those payments as they are received into your
        fire.com GBP or EUR account.


        To set up each Fire Open Payment you first need to create a payment
        request. This contains the details of the payment such as the amount,
        destination account, description as well as various other specific
        fields that you want to associate with the payment. The payment request
        is represented as a URL with a unique code which can then be
        incorporated into an eCommerce shopping cart as an alternative form of
        payment. For example, you can put “Pay by Bank” on your website along
        with “Pay by Card” and “Pay by PayPal”. It can also be distributed by a
        variety of means such as by email, SMS, WhatsApp, encoded as a QR code,
        NFC tag, etc.


        Consumers confirm the payment details such as the amount are correct,
        select their bank and authorise the payment. Payments can be made from
        all major UK banks.


        The funds are settled into your fire.com account, fully reconciled, with
        your specified fields provided.


        There are two implementation options you can use to display payment
        pages with Fire Open Payments.

        1. **Hosted Payment Pages:** fire.com hosts the payment pages - this
        option allows you to re-direct your customer to the hosted fire.com
        payment pages displaying the payment details confirmation, bank
        selection, consent and response pages.

        2. **Integrated Payment Pages:** You host the payments page yourself -
        this option allows you to have control of the UI and UX for displaying
        the payment details confirmation, bank selection and response pages.
        Once the response is received, fire.com can re-direct the payer back to
        your website.


        ## Hosted Payment Pages Option

        ![Image](https://fire.com/docs/images/fop-hosted-flow.png)


        The payer is brought through 5 stages to complete the payment:

        1. **View Payment Details page:** The payer must first be clear on the
        amount of the payment, who they are paying and the reason for the
        payment.

        2. **Select Bank / Account Provider page:** The payer then selects their
        bank. Again this step is offered as part of the fire.com payment UI.

        3. **Consent page:**  The payer must provide consent to the PISP
        (fire.com) prior to authorising the payment. This is a regulatory
        requirement, this page must be hosted by fire.com.

        4. **Authenticate and Authorise Payment:** The payer will be redirected
        to their bank’s online site or mobile banking app. After authenticating,
        the details of the payment will be displayed, and the payer will
        authorise the payment.

        5. **Response page:** It is a regulatory requirement that the PISP
        (fire.com) display the results of the payment and provide the same
        information that would be provided if the payer had made the payment via
        their banking application. fire.com must display this page, before
        optionally redirecting the payer back to your website.


        To implement the hosted Fire Open Payments option you need to do the
        following:

        1. You can create a new Fire Open Payment request either within Firework
        Online or via the API.

        2. Create your new API application with the appropriate permissions
        required in Firework Online, as outlined in the “Authentication” steps.
        The permissions needed are:
            - “Create a Payment Request”
            - “Get Payment Details”

        3. Use the Refresh Token, Client ID and Client Key to create an access
        token as outlined in the “Authentication” steps.

        4. On your website, create a “Pay by Bank” button alongside your other
        available payment methods, such as Cards and PayPal.

        5. After the user clicks on “Pay by Bank”, you need to create a new Fire
        Open Payment request as outlined in the “Create a Fire Open Payment”
        steps. The Create a Fire Open Payment request endpoint returns a unique
        code for the payment request.

        6. Create a URL using the code returned in this format:
        `https://payments.fire.com/{code}` and redirect your customer to this
        page.

        7. fire.com will host all the pages that the customer needs to review
        and authorise the payment. fire.com will will return the paymentUUID of
        the successful or failed transaction to the returnUrl that you supplied
        when creating the Fire Open Payment request. fire.com can also
        optionally send a “webhook” to your website notifying you of the
        transaction’s outcome.

        8. Once fire.com responds with the paymentUUID and/or the webhook to
        your website, you need to call the “Get Payment Details” endpoint to get
        the details of the transaction. This will let you know whether the
        transaction was successful or not. You can set up the “Payment Request
        Payment Authorised” webhook to notify you once the payment is authorised
        or cancelled.

        9. The funds will be received into your GBP or EUR account. Funding will
        typically be within 6 business hours.


        Once the code is returned the payment can be viewed and paid by going to
        the following URL: `https://payments.fire.com/{code}`


        This request creates a new Fire Open Payment Payment. A code is returned
        that can be shared to your customers as a URL by any channel you wish.

        You will need to enable the `PERM_BUSINESS_POST_PAYMENT_REQUEST`
        permission to use this endpoint.

      summary: Create a new batch of payments
      description: >
        The fire.com API allows businesses to automate payments between their
        accounts or to third parties across the UK and Europe.


        For added security, the API can only set up the payments in batches.
        These batches must be approved by an authorised user via the firework
        mobile app.



        The process is as follows:


        **1.**Create a new batch


        **2.**Add payments to the batch


        **3.**Submit the batch for approval


        Once the batch is submitted, the authorised users will receive
        notifications to their firework mobile apps. They can review the
        contents of the batch and then approve or reject it. If approved, the
        batch is then processed. You can avail of enhanced security by using
        Dual Authorisation to verify payments if you wish. Dual Authorisation
        can be enabled by you when setting up your API application in firework
        online.


        **Batch Life Cycle Events**


        A batch webhook can be specified to receive details of all the payments
        as they are processed. This webhook receives notifications for every
        event in the batch lifecycle.


        The following events are triggered during a batch:


        **batch.opened:** Contains the details of the batch opened. Checks that
        the callback URL exists - unless a HTTP 200 response is returned, the
        callback URL will not be configured.


        **batch.item-added:** Details of the item added to the batch


        **batch.item-removed:** Details of the item removed from the batch


        **batch.cancelled:** Notifies that the batch was cancelled.


        **batch.submitted:** Notifes that the batch was submitted


        **batch.approved:** Notifies that the batch was approved.


        **batch.rejected:** Notifies that the batch was rejected.


        **batch.failed:** Notifies that the batch failed - includes the details
        of the failure (insufficient funds etc)


        **batch.completed:** Notifies that the batch completed successfully.
        Includes a summary.


        Push notifications are sent to the firework mobile app for many of these
        events too - these can be configured from within the app.


        This is the first step in creating a batch payment.

      description: >
        There are two ways to process bank transfers - by Payee ID (**Mode 1**)
        or by Payee Account Details (**Mode 2**).


        **Mode 1:** Use the payee IDs of existing approved payees set up against
        your account. These batches can be approved in the normal manner.


        **Mode 2:** Use the account details of the payee. In the event that
        these details correspond to an existing approved payee, the batch can be
        approved as normal. If the account details are new, a batch of New
        Payees will automatically be created. This batch will need to be
        approved before the Payment batch can be approved. These payees will
        then exist as approved payees for future batches.

      Access to the API is by Bearer Tokens. The process is somewhat similar to
      OAuth2.0, but with some changes to improve security.

      1. You must first log into the firework online application and create a
      new Application in the Profile > API page. (You will need your PIN digits
      and 2-Factor Authentication device).

      2. Give your application a Name and select the scope/permissions you need
      the application to have (more on Scopes below).

      3. You will be provided with three pieces of information - the App Refresh
      Token, Client ID and Client Key. You need to take note of the Client Key
      when it is displayed - it will not be shown again.


      You now use these pieces of data to retrieve a short-term Access Token
      which you can use to access the API. The Access Token expires within a
      relatively short time, so even if it is compromised, the attacker will not
      have long to use it. The Client Key is the most important piece of
      information to keep secret. This should only ever be stored on a backend
      server, and never in a front end client or mobile app.


      **If you ever accidentally reveal the Client Key (or accidentally commit
      it to Github for instance) it is vital that you log into firework online
      and delete/recreate the App Tokens as soon as possible. Anyone who has
      these three pieces of data can access the API to view your data and set up
      payments from your account (depending on the scope of the tokens).**


      Once you have the access token, pass it as a header for every call, like
      so:

      `Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN`

      Whenever it expires, create a new nonce and get a new access token again.

      Fire Open Payments is a feature of the fire.com business account that
      leverages Open Banking to allow your customers to pay you via bank
      transfer and to reconcile those payments as they are received into your
      fire.com GBP or EUR account.


      To set up each Fire Open Payment you first need to create a payment
      request. This contains the details of the payment such as the amount,
      destination account, description as well as various other specific fields
      that you want to associate with the payment. The payment request is
      represented as a URL with a unique code which can then be incorporated
      into an eCommerce shopping cart as an alternative form of payment. For
      example, you can put “Pay by Bank” on your website along with “Pay by
      Card” and “Pay by PayPal”. It can also be distributed by a variety of
      means such as by email, SMS, WhatsApp, encoded as a QR code, NFC tag, etc.


      Consumers confirm the payment details such as the amount are correct,
      select their bank and authorise the payment. Payments can be made from all
      major UK banks.


      The funds are settled into your fire.com account, fully reconciled, with
      your specified fields provided.


      There are two implementation options you can use to display payment pages
      with Fire Open Payments.

      1. **Hosted Payment Pages:** fire.com hosts the payment pages - this
      option allows you to re-direct your customer to the hosted fire.com
      payment pages displaying the payment details confirmation, bank selection,
      consent and response pages.

      2. **Integrated Payment Pages:** You host the payments page yourself -
      this option allows you to have control of the UI and UX for displaying the
      payment details confirmation, bank selection and response pages. Once the
      response is received, fire.com can re-direct the payer back to your
      website.


      ## Hosted Payment Pages Option

      The payer is brought through 5 stages to complete the payment:

      1. **View Payment Details page:** The payer must first be clear on the
      amount of the payment, who they are paying and the reason for the payment.

      2. **Select Bank / Account Provider page:** The payer then selects their
      bank. Again this step is offered as part of the fire.com payment UI.

      3. **Consent page:**  The payer must provide consent to the PISP
      (fire.com) prior to authorising the payment. This is a regulatory
      requirement, this page must be hosted by fire.com.

      4. **Authenticate and Authorise Payment:** The payer will be redirected to
      their bank’s online site or mobile banking app. After authenticating, the
      details of the payment will be displayed, and the payer will authorise the
      payment.

      5. **Response page:** It is a regulatory requirement that the PISP
      (fire.com) display the results of the payment and provide the same
      information that would be provided if the payer had made the payment via
      their banking application. fire.com must display this page, before
      optionally redirecting the payer back to your website.


      To implement the hosted Fire Open Payments option you need to do the
      following:

      1. You can create a new Fire Open Payment request either within Firework
      Online or via the API.

      2. Create your new API application with the appropriate permissions
      required in Firework Online, as outlined in the “Authentication” steps.
      The permissions needed are:
          - “Create a Payment Request”
          - “Get Payment Details”

      3. Use the Refresh Token, Client ID and Client Key to create an access
      token as outlined in the “Authentication” steps.

      4. On your website, create a “Pay by Bank” button alongside your other
      available payment methods, such as Cards and PayPal.

      5. After the user clicks on “Pay by Bank”, you need to create a new Fire
      Open Payment request as outlined in the “Create a Fire Open Payment”
      steps. The Create a Fire Open Payment request endpoint returns a unique
      code for the payment request.

      6. Create a URL using the code returned in this format:
      `https://payments.fire.com/{code}` and redirect your customer to this
      page.

      7. fire.com will host all the pages that the customer needs to review and
      authorise the payment. fire.com will will return the paymentUUID of the
      successful or failed transaction to the returnUrl that you supplied when
      creating the Fire Open Payment request. fire.com can also optionally send
      a “webhook” to your website notifying you of the transaction’s outcome.

      8. Once fire.com responds with the paymentUUID and/or the webhook to your
      website, you need to call the “Get Payment Details” endpoint to get the
      details of the transaction. This will let you know whether the transaction
      was successful or not. You can set up the “Payment Request Payment
      Authorised” webhook to notify you once the payment is authorised or
      cancelled.

      9. The funds will be received into your GBP or EUR account. Funding will
      typically be within 6 business hours.


      Once the code is returned the payment can be viewed and paid by going to
      the following URL: `https://payments.fire.com/{code}`
  - name: API
    description: Manage your API Applications and Webhooks
  - name: Transactions
    description: >-
      While there are many types of transactions, they are all represented by
      the same JSON object with a different txnType.
  - name: Direct Debits
    description: >
      The fire.com api allows businesses to automate direct debit payment
      actions on their fire.com business accounts.


      You can retrieve details of your direct debit payments, direct debit
      mandates and also take actions on both your direct debit payments and
      mandates.
  - name: Payment Batches
    description: >
      The fire.com API allows businesses to automate payments between their
      accounts or to third parties across the UK and Europe.


      For added security, the API can only set up the payments in batches. These
      batches must be approved by an authorised user via the firework mobile
      app.



      The process is as follows:


      **1.**Create a new batch


      **2.**Add payments to the batch


      **3.**Submit the batch for approval


      Once the batch is submitted, the authorised users will receive
      notifications to their firework mobile apps. They can review the contents
      of the batch and then approve or reject it. If approved, the batch is then
      processed. You can avail of enhanced security by using Dual Authorisation
      to verify payments if you wish. Dual Authorisation can be enabled by you
      when setting up your API application in firework online.


      **Batch Life Cycle Events**


      A batch webhook can be specified to receive details of all the payments as
      they are processed. This webhook receives notifications for every event in
      the batch lifecycle.


      The following events are triggered during a batch:


      **batch.opened:** Contains the details of the batch opened. Checks that
      the callback URL exists - unless a HTTP 200 response is returned, the
      callback URL will not be configured.


      **batch.item-added:** Details of the item added to the batch


      **batch.item-removed:** Details of the item removed from the batch


      **batch.cancelled:** Notifies that the batch was cancelled.


      **batch.submitted:** Notifes that the batch was submitted


      **batch.approved:** Notifies that the batch was approved.


      **batch.rejected:** Notifies that the batch was rejected.


      **batch.failed:** Notifies that the batch failed - includes the details of
      the failure (insufficient funds etc)


      **batch.completed:** Notifies that the batch completed successfully.
      Includes a summary.


      Push notifications are sent to the firework mobile app for many of these
      events too - these can be configured from within the app.
